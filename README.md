# Parallel-Programming-4-2_Blocked-All-Pairs-Shortest-Path-Multi-cards

## Goal

This assignment helps you get familiar with multi-cards CUDA programming by implementing a blocked all-pairs shortest path algorithm. Besides, to measure the performance and scalability of your program, experiments are required. Finally, we encourage you to optimize your program by exploring different optimizing strategies for optimization points.
